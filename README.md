# CROWD-FUNDING
This smart contract is a crowdfunding contract implemented in Solidity. It allows contributors to send ether to the contract within a specified deadline and minimum contribution amount. The contract keeps track of the raised amount, the number of contributors, and the target amount to be reached. The contract manager can create payment requests, which require majority approval from the contributors. If the target amount is reached and the majority approves the request, the contract automatically transfers the specified amount to the recipient. In case the target is not reached by the deadline, contributors can request a refund.
